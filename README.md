Udacity Project one on writing a Data Science Blog Post

# Overview
This project is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree. 
The aim of the project is to demostrate knowlege of the CRISP-DM Process for Data Analysis and Data Mining, be able to follow the process and then communicate your findings effectively and clearly to an audience.

# Installation
The code in the project can be executed using Anaconda distribution of Python ver 3.x and does not require any additional scripts.

# Repository Contents
The repository contains the following folders and files:

The findings of the project are publish in a blog here.

# Results
With my analysis of the shared data I found out that

The peak season is from June to August and are lowest is from January to March
The rates are higher on weekends
Apartments and Houses comprise of about 90% of total listings
Neighborhoods of Southeast Magnolia, Portage Bay and Westlake have highest mean price, while the neighborhoods of Rainier Beach, Olympic Hills and South Delridge have lowest mean prices
Broadway, Belltown and Wallingford have highest listing counts, while neighborhoods of Roxhill, South Park and Pinehurst have lower listing counts
Accommodation size (determined by number of bedrooms, how many people it accommodates, number of bathrooms) is by far the single biggest price influencer.

Summary
I found that the main driver for prices are how many people a listing can accommodate. Location is also very important aswell as aminities such as TV, parking, Internet and air condition. In order to get good reviews it vital to respond to every inquiry and dont have limitations on maximum nights. those who list many appartments gets worse reviews than thos who only list their own. Amenities are also important for good reviews.

I also found that a Random Forest algorithm can predict AirBnB prices with an accuracy of 65%. I belive alot of the remaining variance in the price can be explained by the listings standard which is not a feature in the dataset.
